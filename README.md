# Let-s-Collaborate
A Real-Time Collaboration Platform enables multiple students to interact with shared content (e.g., documents, whiteboards, or chat) simultaneously and in real-time. The platform could be used for purposes like remote team collaboration, online education, or project management, with a focus on low-latency communication and data consistency.
